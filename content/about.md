*Hello! Welcome to `tskmstr`.*

*Join me on an exhilarating journey through the world of DevOps, where I'll share personal experiences and insights I have accrued over time*

*I have a background in mechanical engineering, and the way I learn is to make things very simple to understand on a fundamental level and then build from there. Almost like a first-principles mental model, sort of, lol.*

*Hang around as I dump my notes; some deep, others not, on the stuff I have learned and/or struggled to understand on here.*
